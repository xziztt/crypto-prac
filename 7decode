EACH TIME ITS A RANDOM ENCODING
SO REVERSE THE ENCODING TYPE
WHEN THE STAGE BECOMES EQUAL TO 100 IT GIVES YOU THE FLAG
STAGE IS INCREMENTED BY ONE WHEN  CREATE_LEVEL FUNCTION IS CALLED
LEVEL IS AUTOMATICALLY INCREMENTED TO 1 IF CURRENT LEVEL IS ZERO
CREATE_LEVEL FUNCTION IS CALLED WHEN THE USER INPUTS THE CORRECT DECODED INPUT
REACH 100TH STAGE TO GET THE FLAG
